#Advanced CSS Layout - Assignment Submission

###From Ben Spears and Keri Brady

In this assignment, we created a new website and utilized the Unsemantic Grid for styling and responsive design. We maintained the ideas we've been taught about CSS, including atomic design and single responsibility, efficient selectors, and the SMACSS system.

We structured the site with semantic markup and HTML5 structure.
