#Advanced CSS Layout - Assignment Submission

###From Ben Spears and Keri Brady

In this assignment, we created a new website and utilized the Unsemantic Grid for styling and responsive design. We maintained the ideas we've been taught about CSS, including atomic design and single responsibility, efficient selectors, and the SMACSS system.

We structured the site with semantic markup and HTML5 structure.

We added the use of media queries with mobile first ideas in mind, and defined them with *em* units instead of pixels to make sure they behave the same way on all devices. The main image was also compressed to reduce the file size by about two thirds. The icons were changed to svg icons that will scale without quality loss.
